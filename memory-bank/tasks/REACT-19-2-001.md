Context:
- Extend the existing Activity component usage from RecipeInput to other components
- Focus on performance benefits: unmount effects when hidden, defer updates
- Opportunities identified: SideBar, modals, loading states, navigation pre-rendering
- Build upon the existing Activity implementation pattern

Acceptance Evidence:
- Before/after performance comparisons
- Memory usage improvements
- Component render cycle optimizations
