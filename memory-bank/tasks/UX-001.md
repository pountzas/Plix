branch: feat/mediacard-image-fallback
timebox_minutes: 60
acceptance_criteria:
  - Fallback UI shown when tmdbPoster is null/undefined (MediaCard)
  - Fallback UI shown when actor profile_path is null/undefined (MediaItem)
  - onError handlers handle failed image loads for both components
  - Graceful degradation with consistent styling across components
  - TypeScript compilation passes
evidence:
  - MediaCard.tsx: Fallback UI implemented with proper error handling
  - MediaItem.tsx: ActorImage component with circular fallback UI and state persistence
  - Bug fixes: Component moved outside parent to prevent state resets, proper circular dimensions
  - Build passes: TypeScript compilation successful after all fixes
  - Performance: Failed images won't retry on re-renders, preventing unnecessary requests
  - Architecture: Proper component isolation for better state management

notes: |
  Add fallback UI when MediaCard image source is not found or fails to load, improving user experience for missing/broken images.
---

Context:

- Current implementation has no error handling for missing tmdbPoster
- TMDB images can fail to load
- Poor UX with broken images
- Need placeholder or icon fallback

Acceptance Evidence:

- Fallback UI displays correctly
- No broken images in UI
- Improved visual consistency
- Error scenarios handled gracefully
