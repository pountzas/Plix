notes: |
  Implement cacheSignal() for direct fetch requests outside React components, providing automatic cleanup when cache expires.
---

Context:
- Build upon existing cache() implementation in generate-recipe API route
- Create utility functions for fetch requests with cacheSignal
- Useful for external service integrations requiring request cancellation
- Extend the React 19.2 caching capabilities

Acceptance Evidence:
- cacheSignal implementation examples
- API utility functions with proper cleanup
- Performance testing with request cancellation
